# Facebook Verification Portal

## Overview

This is a modern, sophisticated Facebook verification portal built with React and Express. The application simulates a Facebook Blue Checkmark verification process with a multi-step workflow, featuring a clean white and light blue design inspired by Apple, LinkedIn, and Stripe UI patterns.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Radix UI components (shadcn/ui)
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Multi-Step Verification Flow
1. **Home Page** (`/`) - Initial verification form with video section
2. **Help Page** (`/help`) - Verification assistance message
3. **Verification Steps** (`/verified`, `/verified2`, `/verified3`, `/verified4`) - Progress through verification stages
4. **Final Step** (`/verified5`) - Backup code submission for completion

### Core Features
- **Responsive Design**: Split-screen layout on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator showing current step
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions with loading overlays
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for actions and errors

### UI Components
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and clean typography
- **Custom Animations**: Fade-in, slide-up, and progress bar animations
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly interactions and responsive layouts

## Data Flow

### Verification Process
1. User submits initial form with `c_user` (Facebook User ID) and `xs` (Session Token)
2. Backend creates verification submission record with unique ID
3. User progresses through verification steps, with each step tracked in database
4. Final step requires 8-digit backup code submission
5. Completion triggers success notification and marks verification as complete

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/verification/submit` - Submit initial verification form
- `POST /api/verification/:id/progress` - Update verification step progress
- `POST /api/verification/:id/backup-code` - Submit final backup code

### Database Schema
- **VerificationSubmission**: Stores verification attempts with user data, current step, and completion status
- Uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date formatting
- **Carousel**: Embla Carousel for media display
- **Animations**: CSS-based animations with TailwindCSS

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with migrations support
- **Session Store**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with React plugin and TypeScript support
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript compiler
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR with runtime error overlay
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports (@/, @shared/)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: TSX for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build with optimized bundles
- **Backend**: ESBuild for Node.js bundle with external dependencies
- **Static Assets**: Served from Express with proper caching headers
- **Database**: Automated migrations on deployment

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment detection (development/production)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
